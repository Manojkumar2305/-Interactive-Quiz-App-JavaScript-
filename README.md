# -Interactive-Quiz-App-JavaScript-
This project is a fully functional interactive quiz application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates core front-end concepts like DOM manipulation, event handling, dynamic element creation, and conditional logic.

The quiz presents multiple-choice questions, highlights user selections, and tracks scores in real-time. Each question is loaded dynamically from a question bank defined in JavaScript. When a user selects an answer:

The selected option is validated as correct or incorrect.

Correct answers are highlighted in green, while incorrect answers turn red.

All answer buttons are disabled after selection to prevent changes.

A Next button is displayed to navigate to the following question.

At the end of the quiz, the application displays the final score along with the total number of questions, and offers the option to restart the quiz for repeated practice.

This project is ideal for:

Beginners learning JavaScript basics.

Practicing DOM manipulation and dynamic UI rendering.

Understanding how to handle user interactions and conditional logic in a real-world mini-project.

Future improvements can include:

Adding a timer for each question.

Randomizing questions and answer orders.

Loading questions from an external JSON file or API.

Keeping track of high scores using local storage.
